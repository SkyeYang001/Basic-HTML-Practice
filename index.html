      <h4><em>"Hey, mister. Does that hat take ten gallons?"</em></h4> 
      <a href='https://y.yarn.co/fe4731d9-0c96-48cc-9367-ca525c5e1c1e_screenshot.jpg'><em>"HAHAHAHA!"</em></a>

      <p>This is not me saying that the 2000s are better than what we had now.
        But we shouldn't discredited the things in the 2000s as lazy and outdated.</p>
    
      <p><strong>I'm saying is that they have charm.</strong></p>
